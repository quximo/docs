# Quximo Overview

Quximo is a developer platform that automates infrastructure, deployment, and operations, turning production environments into a self-service experience.

Instead of assembling CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes manifests, observability stacks, and security tooling manually, teams use Quximo to deploy production-ready services in minutes with everything configured by default: environments, networking, scaling, monitoring, logging, tracing, and alerting.

Quximo is built on proven open-source infrastructure components, but exposes them through a unified platform API and developer interface. This allows teams to move fast without maintaining custom platform tooling or platform engineering teams.

## What Quximo Solves

Most teams struggle with:

* Slow and fragile deployments
* Infrastructure configuration drift
* Missing or inconsistent observability
* Operational toil and platform glue code
* Scaling complexity early in product life

Quximo eliminates these problems by standardizing infrastructure and operational workflows into reproducible, production-grade building blocks.

## What You Get

With Quximo, teams can:

* Deploy new services in minutes
* Get metrics, logs, traces, and alerting by default
* Use standardized environments and deployment workflows
* Avoid writing Terraform, Helm, or Kubernetes YAML
* Operate production systems without building internal platforms

## How Quximo Works

Quximo provides:

* A service catalog and self-service deployment workflows
* An infrastructure orchestration layer built on open-source tooling
* A built-in observability stack
* Secure-by-default networking and runtime isolation
* Environment and service lifecycle management

Developers interact with Quximo through a web UI and API, while platform concerns are handled automatically by the system.

## Who Quximo Is For

Quximo is designed for:

* Startups without platform teams
* Engineering teams building backend systems and microservices
* Companies that want production-grade infrastructure from day one
* Teams that want to move fast without sacrificing reliability
